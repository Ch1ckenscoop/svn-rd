======Locks the skill level on Server.======
= Description =

Locks on a skill level of 1 - 5 and 'skill_1.cfg' - 'skill_5.cfg' also will be executed.

* 1 = Easy Level
* 2 = Normal Level
* 3 = Hard Level
* 4 = Insane Level
* 5 = Brutal Level

For example:
#locks the skill level on 'Normal Level', player set 'Easy Level' is not allowed on server, player only can sets the skill level on or above 'Normal Level'. Also '[[https://github.com/Ch1ckenscoop/svn-rd/blob/master/server/reactivedrop/cfg/skill_2_example.cfg|skill_2.cfg]]' will be executed for this level settings.
#locks the skill level on 'Hard Level', player set 'Normal Level' is not allowed on server, player only can sets the skill level on or above 'Hard Level'. Also '[[https://github.com/Ch1ckenscoop/svn-rd/blob/master/server/reactivedrop/cfg/skill_3_example.cfg|skill_3.cfg]]' will be executed for this level settings

If skill level lock sets to 0, it's default to skill level [[https://github.com/Ch1ckenscoop/svn-rd/blob/master/server/reactivedrop/cfg/skill_2_example.cfg|Normal]], no skill level lock on any levels and runs skill_1.cfg - skill_5.cfg respectively when skill level has changed.

If skill level lock sets to -1, the skill level lock function is completely disabled without running skill_1.cfg - skill_5.cfg.

It is recommended that you create your own files [[https://github.com/Ch1ckenscoop/svn-rd/blob/master/server/reactivedrop/cfg/skill_1_example.cfg|skill_1.cfg]], [[https://github.com/Ch1ckenscoop/svn-rd/blob/master/server/reactivedrop/cfg/skill_2_example.cfg|skill_2.cfg]], [[https://github.com/Ch1ckenscoop/svn-rd/blob/master/server/reactivedrop/cfg/skill_3_example.cfg|skill_3.cfg]], [[https://github.com/Ch1ckenscoop/svn-rd/blob/master/server/reactivedrop/cfg/skill_4_example.cfg|skill_4.cfg]] & [[https://github.com/Ch1ckenscoop/svn-rd/blob/master/server/reactivedrop/cfg/skill_5_example.cfg|skill_5.cfg]], where you can place any settings you like on each level.

=====Important Note:=====

* This skill level lock function as same as plugin 'asw-exec-skills.smx', NO this plugin in your server if 'asw_level_lock' has enabled, otherwise, your server has skill level problems.
