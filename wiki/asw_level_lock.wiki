======Locks the skill level on Server.======
= Description =

* 1 = Easy Level
* 2 = Normal Level
* 3 = Hard Level
* 4 = Insane Level
* 5 = Brutal Level

For example:
#locks the skill level on 'Normal Level', player set 'Easy Level' is not allowed on server, player only can sets the skill level on or above 'Normal Level'. Also '[[https://github.com/ch1ckenscoop/svn-rd/blob/master/server/swarm/cfg/skill_2_example.cfg|skill_2.cfg]]' will be executed for this level settings.
#locks the skill level on 'Hard Level', player set 'Normal Level' is not allowed on server, player only can sets the skill level on or above 'Hard Level'. Also '[[https://github.com/ch1ckenscoop/svn-rd/blob/master/server/swarm/cfg/skill_3_example.cfg|skill_3.cfg]]' will be executed for this level settings

It is recommended that you create your own files [[https://github.com/ch1ckenscoop/svn-rd/blob/master/server/swarm/cfg/skill_1_example.cfg|skill_1.cfg]], [[https://github.com/ch1ckenscoop/svn-rd/blob/master/server/swarm/cfg/skill_2_example.cfg|skill_2.cfg]], [[https://github.com/ch1ckenscoop/svn-rd/blob/master/server/swarm/cfg/skill_3_example.cfg|skill_3.cfg]], [[https://github.com/ch1ckenscoop/svn-rd/blob/master/server/swarm/cfg/skill_4_example.cfg|skill_4.cfg]] & [[https://github.com/ch1ckenscoop/svn-rd/blob/master/server/swarm/cfg/skill_5_example.cfg|skill_5.cfg]], where you can place any settings you like on each level.
